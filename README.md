# CS50

This repo contains all of the problem sets and challenges (homework) for the course CS50 in edx.
I am sharing them in the spirit of open source, and hoping someone can benefit from the them.

I decided to enroll in this course, because although I have been working as a Software Developer for nearly 3 years at the time of this writing
I never studied Computer Science in university. Although most of the stuff taught here were familiar for me, whether from experience, or from reading 
them somewhere, the knowledge I received was immense and I recommend this course to anyone, especially people who are just starting with Computer Science and Programming.

In this light, I would give you the following advice - if you are a student who is taking the course, I strongly recommend solving the challenges yourself.
Writing the code makes all the difference. If, however, you are stuck and need a bit of help, peaking at the solutions can help.

You can sign-up for the course here: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/
