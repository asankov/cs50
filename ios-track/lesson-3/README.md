### iOS Track - Lesson 3

In this lesson we enahnced our app to not show hardcoded data, but instead
to call the `pokeapi.co` API to fetch actual data about Pokemons and display that.

This lesson build on the previous one, so to see the code head to [Lesson 2](../lesson-2/Pokedex).

#### Assignment - Pokedex
[Assignment](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/mobile/ios/pokedex/)

**Solution** - this assignment builds on the work already done, so again check out [Lesson 2](../lesson-2/Pokedex).
